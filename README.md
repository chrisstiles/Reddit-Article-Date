# Reddit Article Date

A Chrome extension that makes it easier to spot misleading or out of date Reddit posts. This extension searches articles linked to from Reddit and tries to determine the original publication date. If one is found, the date is added next to the link in your Reddit feed. Supports both the old and new Reddit designs.
